# milliQanSim

This is the simulation for the MilliQan Detector. Compatibility: Geant 4.9+, ROOT 5.34 and other ROOT5 or ROOT6 onward (ideally ROOT6)

# Quick start for TRIDENT
```bash
# build program
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ../
make -j8

# run program
if [ ! -d config/ ]; then
    cp -r ../inputData/config .
fi
./MilliQan ../runMac/mcp_novis.mac
```

================  Running the simulation  ========================

To run the sim:
Create a build directory, then use ```cmake ../``` and ```make```
Copy the ```/config/``` directory into your build directory. Adjust ```config/particles.ini``` to modify particle properties.
Use ```./MilliQan``` to start the sim. You can either run macros within the geant interface (setting your macropath using ```/control/macroPath /insert/macro/folder/here``` and then ```/control/execute yourmacro.mac```), or you can run via batch mode by using: ```./MilliQan /path/to/your/macro/yourmacro.mac```.

================  Quick run script  =========================

ALTERNATIVELY, TO RUN THE SIMULATION:
I've written some nice macros which build everything, modify everything, and copy everything from scratch for five processes:

1)```cosmicSetup.sh```: This sets up the full bar detector + cavern and runs a cosmic muon sim

2)```cosmicSetupSlab.sh```: This sets up the full slab detector + cavern and runs a cosmic muon sim

3)```benchSetup.sh```: For bench tests of a single bar + 1 PMT. The default script runs a Cd109 source

4)```benchSetupSlab.sh```: For bench tests of a single slab + 4 PMT. The default script runs a Cd109 source (although Am241 is likely the source data will use)

5)```gammaSetup.sh```: For an NaI detector geometry. The default script runs a Cd109 source.

(others are being added regularly)

Just run those bash scripts and sit back. Do look at the scripts themselves to see what's being done; usually it's just copying over the files needed to change the sim into that type, building the sim, then running the sim using the default script.

================  Visualization  =========================

The visualization macro is vis.mac. To run with visualization:
```
./MilliQan
/control/macroPath /path/to/your/milliQanSim/runMac/
/control/execute vis.mac
/control/execute specmuonFullPropagated_no_vis.mac (for cosmics/full sim)
```
or

```/control/execute sidegamma_no_vis.mac``` (for various bench testing setups)

You can use ```quickmuon.mac``` (and ```quickmuon_pencil.mac```) to throw muons at the sim if you turn on ```/run/beamOn 1``` (or more), or use ```mcp_vis.mac``` to throw mCPs at the demonstrator (if your ```MilliQan.cc``` is configured properly). These use OGL; if you prefer a different visualization package or your geant build doesn't use OGL, there are several other options available (need to modify/write your own macro though). Also, mcp_vis is provided for visualization and generation of mCPs (just ```vis.mac``` + ```mcp_novis.mac```).

================  Macros  =========================

The two macros suggested for running with cosmics and NaI gammas are, respectively:

--```specmuonFullPropagated_no_vis.mac``` (fully simulated distribution of muons from surface of earth; most accurate, the one I use most often)

--```sidegamma_no_vis.mac``` (has lots of xray sources built in you can uncomment, but in particular can be used to simulate Cd109 which milliQan uses for calibration

Other batch macros:

--```muon_no_vis.mac``` (pencil beam of muons with some initial spatial distribution)

--```specmuon_no_vis.mac``` (cos^2 distribution of muons)

--```specmuon45_no_vis.mac``` (cos^2 dist. of muons but truncated at 45 degrees)

--```mcp_novis.mac``` (generates mCPs based on 4vectors. This is the default generation scheme if you just use ```/run/beamOn 1``` assuming ```MilliQPrimaryGeneratorAction``` is your particle generator)

You can copy any of these and change the source to other particle types, of course.

To use macros with ```/gps/``` (general particle source) commands, you can comment out ```MilliQPrimaryGeneratorAction``` and uncomment ```mqPrimaryGeneratorAction``` in ```MilliQan.cc```. For any trajectory-loading simulations (namely beam muons and mCPs), you must use a ```G4ParticleGun```-compatible command (usually most ```/gps/``` commands have a ```/gun/``` equivalent, but not all).

================ Saving movies ======================

I have added movie-saving scripts to runMac. To use them, just run the visMovieRun script in an interactive session, then find an event you want, and turn it into a movie by executing visMovieSave. There are two pairs of these files: one for cosmics and one for beam-induced events. Here is an example for how to save a cosmic movie:
```
./MilliQan
/control/macroPath /path/to/install/milliQanSim/runMac/
/control/execute visMovieRunCosmic.mac
/run/beamOn 1 (one at a time until you find an event you like)
/control/execute visMovieSaveCosmic.mac
```
The best way to save these is to use a tool like peek (a screen recording tool that saves the screen as a gif) and just record the event as it plays back. If you want to see an event multiple times you can run ```visMovieSaveCosmic.mac``` each time, but be sure to delete the ```g4_N``` files from the build dir in between running this script, else the viewer will play the event back multiple times.

If the sim is taking a long time to save the tracks (basically, it just hangs for longer than a minute or so after executing an event), I suggest changing the light yield in the detector construction to a much lower value (around line 2244, set ```mptPlScin->AddConstProperty("SCINTILLATIONYIELD", 100. / MeV);```). If there are more than 10k events produced (and really, much more than 5k) the event will just take forever to run, so this helps get better vis quicker.

For beam muon visualizations the Cerenkov light is also pretty strong which makes the sim movie vis take a long time even if scintillation is turned off, you might want to add a line to ```mqSteppingAction``` deleting photons created by Cerenkov. If you don't feel comfortable doing this, maybe just stick to visualizing mCPs and cosmics.



================  MODIFYING SIMULATION SETTINGS  =========================

Basically everything  having to do with geometry is constructed in the ```mqDetectorConstruction```. Everything having to do with saved data is stored in ```mqSteppingAction``` (particle stuff) and ```mqPMTSD``` (detector stuff), with a couple other pieces in ```mqTrackingAction``` also. Physics is defined using ```mqShieldingPhysicsList```. Outputs and datastructures are defined using ```mqUserEventInformation``` (for event level things), ```mq[ParticleName]Track``` (for particle scoring information) and then ```mqROOTEvent``` (to convert data into a ROOT file). If you want to modify any sim feature, go to the relevant files and you'll find the information there. For example, if you want to rotate the demonstrator, or turn on/off the cavern, you'll find that in ```mqDetectorConstruction```. If it's not obvious how to modify something, just email me and I'll be happy to explain. Some of this is detailed in a source file readme: ```src/FileDescription.txt``` 


IMPORTANT: When running your macro, be sure to change the destination filepath in ```runMac/specmuon_no_vis.mac``` and ```runMac/muon_no_vis.mac``` or (equivalent) so your data gets stored somewhere (if you don't enable this, it'll just get named ```Sim123456789.root``` or similar). To use macros from within the Geant4 interactive terminal, use ```/control/macroPath /path/to/milliQanSim/runMac/``` followed by ```/control/execute yourmacro.mac```


================  DEPENDENCY INFORMATION  =========================

The following software dependencies are required to run this simulation. If you want to figure out how to expand software support or if you have knowledge about how to expand these software dependencies to support more builds, please email me at the address below (or feel free to make the commits yourself). Additional dependencies for ROOT and Geant4 may be required, see the documentation for those packages for more information.


ROOT v6: Currently using ROOTv6.24 on most installs, but most ROOT6 versions should work fine. If you desperately need ROOT5 compatibility, email me and I can explain how to try to get that going... but you should probably just use ROOT6. ROOT7 might be compatible but untested as of now (8/7/23)..

gcc4.8+ for ROOT6 (no upper bound) : Tested working on gcc4.8.5, gcc7.4.0, 9.4.0  on ROOT6. Using C++11 standard in general.

Geant4.9.6+ : Build originally developed on Geant4.9.6, confirmed working on Geant4.10.7 and 10.5. Not tested on Geant4.8 or previous, and using Geant4.11 will cause a problem. It's likely simple to migrate, but I haven't dont it yet; use G4.10 unless you want to figure that out.

When building Geant4, use the following cmake command, ideally using Geant4.10.5: cmake -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON -DGEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/geant4.10.5-install /path/to/geant4.10.05.p01

This command has 2 install options: -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON, which installs precision Geant4 datasets, and -DGEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11=ON, which is needed for visualization. You can install other visualization options this way and try them by appropriately modifying the runMac/vis.mac file if you don't want to deal with command line visualization.

CMake2.6+ : CMake will refuse to build unless this is true. Tested under CMake 3.14.1, should work under CMake3 for all versions but these have not been exhaustively tested

BOOST: To use the ```MilliQPrimaryGeneratorAction.cc``` class, you must add BOOST libraries to your dependencies. There are lots of ways to do this, but the laziest way is to just add the boost libraries to your GEANT include dir. Currently using boost v1.70.0. Note that I currently add BOOST libraries (at least, in cvmfs) by explicitly adding an include line to CMakeLists.txt. CMakeLists.txt doesn't play well with environmental variables/my knowledge of CMake is limited, otherwise I'd make this automatic (at least on cvmfs).
